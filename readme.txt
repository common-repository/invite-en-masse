== PHP4 ==

Many of my plugin now require at least PHP5. I know that WordPress officially supports PHP4, but I don't. PHP4 is a mess and makes coding a lot less efficient, and when you're releasing stuff for free these things matter. PHP5 has been out for several years now and is fully production ready, as well as being naturally more secure and performant.

If you're still running PHP4, I strongly suggest you talk to your hosting company about upgrading your servers. All reputable hosting companies should offer PHP5 as well as PHP4.

Right, that's it. Grump over. ;)
